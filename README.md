## Introduction
RAB is is the yield farming on EOS. The private key is burned and the contract code is open source.
The project has no pre-mine, no founder shares, no VC interests. RAB uses TVI (Total Value Inflow) as the project.
The token distribution index will not cause precipitation in the fund pool. The contract will automatically return
90% of the funds to the participating EOS accounts and donate 10% as follow-up development and operation funds.

## Security

### No pool of funds
RAB uses the TVI model as a project value assessment, and will not lock any funds in the contract, so it can ensure the 100% security of the contract.

### Private keys burned
RAB has given the authority to the system account `eosio`, the project has no control and cannot update the contract (unless the 21 BPs agree).
